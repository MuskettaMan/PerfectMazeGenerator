<h1 id="perfect-maze-generator">Perfect Maze Generator</h1>
<h2 id="functional-requirements">Functional Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>A perfect maze generator</li>
<li>The game requires UI elements to:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Change the width of the maze;</li>
<li>Change the height of the maze;</li>
<li>(Re)generate the maze;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The maze is to be displayed in it’s entirety on the screen regardless of its size, with minimum white space surrounding it;</li>
<li>Your game will be tested on desktop in the editor - exporting to mobile is not required;</li>
<li>Your code will undergo the most scrutiny during our review, make sure it’s well structured and extensively commented;</li>
<li>You’re free to design the appearance of both the maze and interface - a basic/simple design will not be judged negatively, but a good design will leave a good impression;</li>
<li>Use C#.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bonus-points-for-a-good-impression-all-optional">Bonus points for a good impression (all optional)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implement more than one maze generating algorithm and allow the user to change algorithms using the interface;</li>
<li>Implementing animations is encouraged - DTT makes use of the LeanTween animation asset, but you’re free to choose your own;</li>
<li>Add a character that is able to navigate through the maze via user input;</li>
<li>Have a fun idea? Feel free to implement it :)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>It is not allowed to make use of the Unity Asset Store for anything directly related to the essence of this test. Assets related to design, animations, particle effects, etc. are allowed, but use them sensibly and with clear purpose.</p>
